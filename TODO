TODO (what the framework should do):

- test that given set of rpms (jdk x os x arch) satisfies:

	* names of the pkgs are as expected
	- priority check
	 	- debugpackage have lowered, contains version/release, length is known, prefix s known
	x all subpackages are present
	* download single-arch (+noarch) parts of build from brew/koji
	* none subpackage is empty unless expected
	- provides are as expected
	- plugin, javaws, jcontrol sanity
		- if plugin pkg is present, then javaws and jcontrol files should be in that pkg
		- if plugin pkg is present, then it should provide javaws and jcontrol
	- broken symlinks
	- alternatives are correct
	- alternatives and binaries in bin or jre/bin are correct
	- man page corresponds to existing manpages, to alternatives and to binaries in bin jre/bin
	- desktop shortcuts are sane
	- all connections of  binaries x desktop files x alternatives are sane
	- download whole build from brew/koji (a set of rpms for each arch) and check:
		- correct set of architectures is present
		- test each architecture separately

* generate in human-readable form, what it itself test

- todo
x work inprogress
* done

notes:
	for sake of this testsuite, ITW is considered as special jdk, with plugin package only
