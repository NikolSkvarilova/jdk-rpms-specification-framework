System config

To verify the filesystem, mock tool is used.
As really many "install - do something - check" wehre install is always the same, sometimes even "do something" is same then snapshot schema in mock is used.

You need mock-lvm to have installed and set up
Generally you need to provide LVM group to mock.
As you proabbly don't have spare partitions for new group, there is some reading followed by simple exmaple how to provide *file* as new partititon and how to make it lvm group:

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Logical_Volume_Manager_Administration/LVM_examples.html#vol_create_ex

as you can see:
mock -r fedora-24-x86_64 --list-snapshots
ERROR: Feature list_snapshots is not provided by any of enabled plugins
it do nto work out of box

mkdir MOCK_SNAPSHOT_LVM
cd MOCK_SNAPSHOT_LVM
dd if=/dev/zero of=lvm.img bs=100 count=100M
# 10GB "partition should be enough"
sudo losetup -f
# /dev/loop0
sudo losetup /dev/loop0 lvm.img
# be sure to use unused
sudo vgcreate MOCK_SNAPSHOT_LVM  /dev/loop0
# Physical volume "/dev/loop0" successfully created
# Volume group "MOCK_SNAPSHOT_LVM" successfully created

now use this new VG in /etc/mock/site-defaults.cfg:

config_opts['plugin_conf']['root_cache_enable'] = False
config_opts['plugin_conf']['lvm_root_enable'] = True
config_opts['plugin_conf']['lvm_root_opts'] = {
     'volume_group': 'MOCK_SNAPSHOT_LVM',
     'size': '9G',
     'pool_name': 'mock',
     'check_size': True,
 }
 # this example is vasing 1gb for overhead, few kilos should be enough


Simple check:
 mock -r fedora-24-x86_64 --list-snapshots
 Snapshots for fedora-24-x86_64:
says it works


If you have any mocks *before* the mock-lvm isntalaltion and setup, they will not provide the functionality:
mock -r fedora-24-x86_64 --snapshot mvn
INFO: mock.py version 1.2.18 starting (python version = 3.4.3)...
Start: init plugins
INFO: selinux disabled
Finish: init plugins
Start: run
ERROR: Command failed:
 # lvcreate -s MOCK_SNAPSHOT_LVM/+mock.fedora-24-x86_64.head -n mock.fedora-24-x86_64.mvn
  Snapshot origin LV +mock.fedora-24-x86_64.head not found in Volume group MOCK_SNAPSHOT_LVM.

You need to
 mock -r fedora-24-x86_64 --scrub=all
 them all, and recreate

Now
 mock -r fedora-24-x86_64 --list-snapshots
Snapshots for fedora-24-x86_64:
* postinit

it works.
